# TODO

· Looking back on the experience, I think it would make more sense if I had paid more importance to the django/Dockerfile and focused my efforts there earlier on.

· I also think I should of had a closer look at the project structure in order to better avoid many of the issues that I encountered.

· Overall I still had to succesfully deploy to DigitalOcean and verify the Sentry integration was working, both of which I was not able to accomplish due to running out of time.

· These are the things I would fix/finish if I did have more time. I´d also more than likely integrate a few other extra services into the mix and bring back the STAGING env I had ditched.

· I am going to keep the source files etc and when I find myself with extra time I will definitely come back to it with a refined approach. 
 
· You live and you learn! Thank you for the opportunity and the challenge provided!
